        "content": "Hello all,<br/><br/>You may or may not have heard recently there was a tweet made by Jeb from Mojang regarding launchers stealing client details (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeb_/status/461070509992849410\">source</a>). While this was not aimed at us entirely, it did involve us in some way.<br/><br/>To understand this, you need to understand how Minecraft's authentication system works.<br/><br/>You put your username and password in, then that is sent off to Mojang's servers which then determines if it's a correct login or not. If it's valid Mojang send's a token back which is used to login to servers and successfully authenticates you. That's where it usually ends. That token is sent into the Minecraft process and used as needed.<br/><br/>About 5 months ago we added in a system which was created to stop cracked clients from being made and creating a drain and added cost to our servers. What this involved was sending the token that Mojang gave you for your login, to our servers which would then be re-authenticated with Mojang to make sure the user was a legitimate Minecraft account holder. We didn't log the tokens or use them for any nefarious reasons, we had no intention of doing bad, this was all done to protect ourselves from bad people. The only way your details could be compromised would have been if the servers were hacked and that data was looked at or recorded else where. This would allow the attacker to login to servers as you.<br/><br/>Since we added it in from the very beginning we invalidated all tokens that were received to our servers, meaning even if someone did get your token, they would need to use it within about 2 seconds before it got invalidated and no longer working.<br/><br/>We definitely didn't expect this to get this out of hand, and we never meant this in a harmful way, it was to protect us and our servers, being a small 2 person operation funded from our donors and our own pockets. I take full responsibility for this and apologize to all.<br/><br/>If you wish to be 100% certain that there is no issues, then you can login to the Vanilla Launcher once to refresh your login tokens. The latest update 3.1.24 has removed all these systems and all server side code has been removed. Be sure your running version 3.1.24 by checking at the top of the console or the ATLauncher main window. If not then please restart or download the update manually at http://www.atlauncher.com/downloads/<br/><br/>Again sorry for any confusion or worry we have caused over this issue and again more apologies on my behalf.<br/><br/>Thanks"
